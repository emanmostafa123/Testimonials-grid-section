                      I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.
                       I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                       The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course,
                     I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ” </p>

                <p class="kirawords2">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code.
                    I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.
                     I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. 
                     The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. 
                     The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. 
                     In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience.
                    It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
